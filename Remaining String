Problem :: Remaining String
Given a string s without spaces, a character ch and an integer count. Your task is to return the substring that remains after the character ch has appeared count number of times.
Note:  Assume upper case and lower case alphabets are different. “”(Empty string) should be returned if it is not possible, or the remaining substring is empty.

Time Complexity :: O(N)
Space Complexity :: O(1)

Code ::
 class Solution {
  public:
    string printString(string s, char ch, int count) {
        for(int i=0 ; i<s.length() ; i++){
            if(s[i] == ch)count--;
            if(count==0)return s.substr(i+1);
        }
        return "";
    }
};
